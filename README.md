# 🐯 L9Tigrotto's Profile 🐯

## 🧩 Who am I?

Hey, I'm L9Tigrotto. I love C, and most of all C#. Much like Amumu seeking friends in the jungle, I hunt for elegant solutions and efficient code. When I'm not supporting my team or clearing camps, I'm crafting software with the same dedication I use to secure dragons and Barons.

## 💻 Languages I work with

- C
- C# (favorite)
- Some other stuff when absolutely necessary

## 🎮 League stuff

- Main roles: Support > Jungle > ADC when forced
- Favorite champion: Amumu (we have a lot in common) and vayne (has cool sunglasses and gameplay)
- "Report jungle diff" - My ADC, every game

## 🚀 What I'm working on

Currently building my own programming language from scratch. It's nowhere near done, but it's mine and I enjoy the process. The compiler is written in C# because it's the superior language.

I also put together Minecraft modpacks for me and my friends. I find and combine Minecraft mods to create custom gameplay experiences. Not a fan of Java but sometimes you gotta deal with it to get things working. I'm the guy who always finds the bugs nobody else notices and reports them to the mod authors.

## 🙅‍♂️ Things I avoid

- Java (unless absolutely necessary for Minecraft mods)
- Web development nonsense
- People who say "just use Python" when I talk about my C# projects
